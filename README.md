# Wanted: Memory Edition

* A memory card game that allows users to play a game that challenges their brain. This project will help improve memory, concentration, and pattern recognition by requiring players to recall and match pairs of cards. Built with React, SCSS and Vite, it emphasizes fast performance and a smooth user experience.

This application allows user to:
* Enables players to challenge their memory by recalling previously selected items in a dynamic memory game.
* Tracks and saves each player's highest score, encouraging replayability and personal improvement.


## Features

* __Persistent Best Score__: Whether the player wins or loses, their best score is automatically saved to the database. When they return to play again, their top performance will be displayed for continued motivation.
* __Match Log__: Every game session is recorded and stored in the database. Players can review their match history anytime through the dedicated Match Log page.
* __Game Modes__: Players can choose from multiple difficulty levels—Easy, Medium, and Hard—each offering a unique set of challenges to suit different skill levels.

## Learnings 

* __Lodash Library__: Utilized Lodash’s shuffle function, which is based on the Fisher-Yates algorithm, to efficiently randomize data—perfect for game logic such as shuffling character sets.
* __useEffect Hook__: Gained a deeper understanding of the useEffect hook, including when and why to use it. Learned how to manage side effects, fetch data, and control component lifecycles more effectively in React.
* __Tailwind CSS__: Mastered styling with Tailwind CSS, significantly improving development speed and UI consistency. Its utility-first approach made it easier to build clean, responsive designs—this framework has become an essential part of my workflow.

## Challenges Faced

* __Burnout__: During the course of this project, I experienced occasional burnout. There were days when I couldn't bring myself to code—sometimes going a day or two without any progress. This lack of consistency made it harder to stay motivated and maintain momentum.
* __Game Logic Challenges__: Developing a game involves a unique set of logical structures and patterns. I found this aspect particularly challenging, as it was an area I was less experienced in. As a result, some parts of the game's logic and architecture could definitely be improved.
* __Tailwind CSS Learning Curve__: This was my first time using Tailwind CSS, so building the UI was initially time-consuming. There was a learning curve involved, but I dedicated a significant amount of time to understanding its utility classes and design philosophy. Despite the challenges, this experience greatly improved my frontend development skills.

## Future Planning:

* __UI Design Enhancements__: Improve the overall visual appeal of the game by refining the UI and incorporating subtle animations—especially on interactive elements like cards. These enhancements will help create a more immersive experience that aligns better with the One Piece theme.
* __Sound Integration__: Introduce engaging audio elements, including background music, character or theme-specific sounds, and interactive audio cues. This would significantly increase player engagement and make the game more dynamic and immersive.
* __Game Settings Panel__: Add a dedicated settings menu that allows players to customize various aspects of the game—such as sound volume, difficulty, visual effects, and accessibility options—giving users more control over their experience.
Expanded Game Modes: Implement additional game modes with unique rules or challenges. This could include timed modes, survival challenges, or special character-based rounds to make gameplay more diverse and replayable.
